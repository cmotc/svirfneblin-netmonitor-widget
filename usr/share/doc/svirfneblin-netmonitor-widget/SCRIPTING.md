Creating Exploit Scripts launchable from Netmonitor Widget
==========================================================

Some kinds of exploits against vulnerable systems might be convenient to use
from an interface which discovers when they are available on the network. Lots
of systems to do something like this, but they usually prefer different ways of
presenting the user interface which require more options to be set manually
at runtime. The best exploits to interface with the netmonitor widget are ones
which can be run with default settings, fired directly at a URL, or otherwise
be run with only a hostname/ip address, port and service, because that's what
the widget sends it by default. Any other information you need will have to be
gathered or generated by the script.
